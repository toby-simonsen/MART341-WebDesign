# Assignment 3
## Toby Simonsen

This is supposed to be a paragraph, which could contain any sort of information ever. The possibilities are **endless**. So many choices, I am struggling to decide on just one. So I write about the paragraph itself. It has multiple sentences that are all related, more or less anyways. I would like to improve my paragraph writing skills, and perhaps move onto writing parapgraphs about something *other than paragraphs alone*.

Things I could possibly write about:
- Websites
- My hobbies, like rock climbing or bikes
- The best coffee in town
- Much more!

Here is a link to one of my favorite [websites](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
